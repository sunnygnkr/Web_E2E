Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available, 
pushing any following elements to the next line they are <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>,
<table>, <form>, etc.

Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary for their
content. They flow within the text and do not create a new line they are <span>, <a>, <strong>, 
<em>, <img>, <br>, <input>, etc.

In HTML, semantic elements are special tags that provide meaning to the content within them. Instead of using non-semantic elements like <div> or <span> for everything, semantic elements should be used whenever they match the meaning of the content they contain.
Here are some examples of semantic elements in HTML:
<header>: Represents the header of a section or a page. Typically contains a logo, navigation menu, or other introductory content.
<nav>: Defines a navigation menu. It is used to wrap a set of navigation links.

We can create links to travel to different sections on the same page using <section id="xyz"> and
then using a semantic(giving clear idea about the element) element like <nav> -> <a href="#xyz">

<target="_blank"> : will open in a new tab

<href="/"> : will take to the root page

title="xyz" will show xyz when we hover over the targeted element

The end of browser page below which we can't see anything is called Fold.

In addition to these two primary categories, there are also "inline-block" elements. An inline-block
element behaves like an inline element (occupying only as much space as necessary) but can have a 
width and height set, and other block-level properties applied to it.
Example:
<span style="display: inline-block; width: 100px; height: 50px; background-color:white />
