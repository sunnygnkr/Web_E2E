Remember that in HTML the <p> always creates some space between the next <p> element.

We can create links to travel to different sections on the same page using <section id="xyz"> and
then using a semantic(giving clear idea about the element) element like <nav> -> <a href="#xyz">

<target="_blank"> : will open in a new tab

<href="/"> : will take to the root page

title="xyz" will show xyz when we hover over the targeted element

The end of browser page below which we can't see anything is called Fold.
